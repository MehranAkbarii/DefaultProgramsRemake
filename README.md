**To do:**

-Add feature to make an app or a program the default for all file types it can open at once.

-Add feature to make an app or a program the default for multiple file types it can open at once.

**Notes:**

Set Default Programs page from Default Programs (sud.dll) (Removed in Windows 10 1709-1803) is the only control panel page from windows 8 , 8.1 era that cannot be restored and cannot be remade completely and even there is no good replacement application for it even I could not remake it functionalities completely "Set default app or program for file types by app." feature was the only thing that I could remake it , but it is not perfect either because some of current defaults would not show in list view.

These 4 functionalities are still missing (last two functionalities even missing in ms-settings page and completely removed from windows):

-Set default app or program for protocols by app. (there is no way to change protocols associations without using ms-settings or classic Default Programs\Set Associations page because Windows uses hashes to prevent changing protocols Associations by directly editing registry values ​​by users and third-party apps, Hash value data and ProgID value data are not changeable directly ​​by users and third-party apps)

-Make an app or a program the default for some rare file types it can open.

-Make an app or a program the default for all file types and protocols it can open at once.

-Make an app or a program the default for multiple file types or protocols it can open at once.
